# Image to ICO Converter (MagIC)

MagIC (I**Mag**e to **I**CO **C**onverter) is a simple tool to convert any image file into a .ico file. Its primary purpose is to provide file icons, to be used for custom shortcuts.

## Description

This project was created to streamline and localize OS customization. Localization/Non-dependance is an important goal for this project, as well as many of my other ones. Likewise, the motivation behind this script is mostly out of spite, as vitually all online converters are severly limited.
